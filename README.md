# Staging module for Miltenyi - MACSIMA to MCMICRO

The macsima2mc.py script stages MACSima data sets for being registerd with ASHLAR in MCMICRO.

The script takes as main input the path to the cycle folder that cointains the raw tiles generated by the Miltenyi-MACSima platform.  macsima2mc.py reads these tiles and distributes them into acquisition groups. i.e tiles with common rack, well, ROI and exposure levels will be written into an ome.tiff file with the necessary metadata for registration.  To be more precise two such ome.tiff files will be generated per cycle, one corresponds to the background signal and the other to the markers signal.
